## My process

* Set HTML layout.
* Create CSS external file to set style for HTML layout:
  * Choose to use responsive web design for image by using max-width property for image, and including meta viewport element in my web page. It works on Mobile (375px) and Desktop (1440px) as well.
  * Use css techniques to center vertically or horizontally:
    ```css
    /*center horizontally*/
    .im {
      display: block;
      margin-left: auto;
      margin-right: auto;
    }

    /*center horizontally and vertically*/
    .content {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }
    ```
  * Set colors, font size and family according `style-guide.md`

### What I learned

In that challenge I found out that The Markdown Guide is a new subject for me. I am new in that subject.
I had a short overwiev of [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

### Continued development

- Next learning subject is going to be The Markdown Guide. 
- I am not confortable with choosing which layout system to use when you start new webpage. There are several of them with some advantages and disadvantages. I think It comes with practice, experience.
- I still dig deeper in JavaScript.
